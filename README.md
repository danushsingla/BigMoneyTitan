# BigMoneyTitan

LLM built from scratch using my own transformers and my own specially built tokenizer.

Originally trained on Lord of the Rings books to be able to write more stories using Tolkien-language. Has been improved over the course of a few months, mixing in some components from the (at the time) recent Titan reseearch paper that released ground-breaking methodologies for having a strong-memory LLM.
